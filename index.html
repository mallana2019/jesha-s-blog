    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a crazy and Lovesick girl.There was a time when i have been through so much pain.i have been so lonely and as days passed pain slowly became my friend and eventually i became numb.i was okay being alone since then as my painful memories
      taught me not to get close again  and to always play it safe.then He came to my life ."My ChumbyðŸ’‹" the true love of my life.i cant express in words how much i love him.i am just crazy for him like anything.i have not had a chance to feel him for real.but i know that day is not so far that he will be sleeping on my lap and i would be caressing his hair .sometimes i get so careless that he gets
      so mad .But i just love him a lot and will love him forever."My Mahal My chum ðŸ˜˜" </p>

      <h2>sleeping</h2>
      <p>Itâ€™s a perfect activity for a lazy person like me And being that much lazy anything  which provides me comfort, forces me to close my eyes I dont deny ðŸ¤£ .i love to roam in dreamlands. If u ask
        if i were to choose between my sleep and my chumby ,i would definitely choose my sleep over him ðŸ¤ª but i would surely sleep in his arms ðŸ’‹</p>
